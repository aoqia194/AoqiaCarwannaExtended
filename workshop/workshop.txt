title=aoqia's carwanna extended
description=This mod is an extention of the original CarWanna mod by Xyberviri and is completely open-source under the GPLv3 license.
description=It is created at the request of a server owner and I don't have the most time to maintain it.
description=It most likely will not be directly compatible with older saves due to sandbox options being different and the removal of a LOT of unused pinkslip items in the code.
description=
description=This being said, I will still provide updates and features where requested.
description=Considering the original mod is not receiving any more updates, this takes its place.
description=
description=Credits go to the original mod owner Xyberviri.
